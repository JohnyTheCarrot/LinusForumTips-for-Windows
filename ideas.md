## Ideas for the Windows 10 App

### Annotation support using Windows Inking*1 (May come in Version 1.12.0)
This would add a new button in the appbar/commandbar and would pause any video being 
played so that the user can use a Windows Ink supported Digital Pen*3 OR Touch Input*2
or the Surface Dial*3 to annotate and export an image of the video with any drawings.
